# PPPwn - PlayStation 4 PPPoE RCE
PPPwn is a kernel remote code execution exploit for PlayStation 4 upto FW 11.00. This is a proof-of-concept exploit for [CVE-2006-4304](https://hackerone.com/reports/2177925) that was reported responsibly to PlayStation.

Supported versions are:
- FW 9.00
- FW 9.03 / 9.04
- FW 9.50 / 9.60
- FW 10.00 / 10.01
- FW 10.50 / 10.70 / 10.71
- FW 11.00
- more can be added (PRs are welcome)

The exploit only prints `PPPwned` on your PS4 as a proof-of-concept. In order to launch Mira or similar homebrew enablers, the `stage2.bin` payload needs to be adapted.

## Requirements
- Computer with Ethernet port
  - USB adapter also works
- Ethernet cable
- Linux
  - You can use VirtualBox to create a Linux VM with `Bridged Adapter` as network adapter to use the ethernet port in the VM.
- Python3 and gcc installed

## Usage

On your computer, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Siverslayer/PPPwn
```

Install the requirements:

```sh
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
open Download library.bat

On your PS4:

- Go to `Settings` and then `Network`
- Select `Set Up Internet connection` and choose `Use a LAN Cable`
- Choose `Custom` setup and choose `PPPoE` for `IP Address Settings`
- Enter anything for `PPPoE User ID` and `PPPoE Password`
- Choose `Automatic` for `DNS Settings` and `MTU Settings`
- Choose `Do Not Use` for `Proxy Server`
- Click `Test Internet Connection` to communicate with your computer

after that in GUI

If the exploit fails or the PS4 crashes, you can skip the internet setup and simply click on `Test Internet Connection`. If the `pppwn.py` script is stuck waiting for a request/response, abort it and run it again on your computer, and then click on `Test Internet Connection` on your PS4.

If the exploit works, you should see an output similar to below, and you should see `Cannot connect to network.` followed by `PPPwned` printed on your PS4.
